Advanced workout tracking for in-depth analysis

This app uses an exercise database found [here](https://strengthtoovercome.com/functional-fitness-exercise-database).
Thanks a lot to that guy for making it available for free!

## Roadmap
This is a basic roadmap of what I would like to implement before being happy to call it 'v1.0.0'

- [x] Can log exercises/workouts
- [x] Can log sleep and mental health metrics
- [x] Can create saved routines
- [x] Can log meals data
- [ ] Use exercise database with richer data (in progress)
- [ ] Allow making custom exercises (in progress)
- [ ] Comprehensive analysis page, with custom analyses (in progress)
- [ ] Use nutrition info database to make up meals
- [ ] UI/UX overhaul to be clean and consistent
